Design of an efficient algorithm for parallel prefix-scan of a large array of
values on GPUs.

The experiments were done with guidance from [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli] and
[Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee].

### Comparision on large graphs

In this experiment ([input-large]), we first compute ...

From the results, we make make the following observations ...
